# Personal Projects
This repo contains my personal projects in modeling dynamic systems. Please check out each folder for more details. The current projects include LQR control for cartpole and acrobot systems. My plans is to implement an LQR control for a drone in the future.

All projects so far are implemented in Python with the casadi library and Mujoco.
